    // .aggregate() method in MongoDB (and Mongoose) is used to perform advanced data processing and transformations directly in the database â€” much more powerful than .find() or .count().

    // Use of .aggregate() when you want to:
    // Group data-	Count students in each course
    // Join collections-	Get course names from Courses while querying Students
    // Transform documents-	Add/remove/change fields in output
    // Filter, sort, paginate complex results-	Like WHERE, ORDER BY, etc.
    // Calculate statistics-	Averages, sums, counts, etc.

    // $group Stage: Groups students by course (assuming each student document has a course field with ObjectId).
    //     _id: "$course": Groups by the course ID.
    // studentCount: { $sum: 1 }: Counts the number of students in each course.

    // $lookup Stage: Groups students by course (assuming each student document has a course field with ObjectId).
    //   Purpose: Joins course details from the courses collection.
    // localField: "_id": The course ID from the grouped result.
    // foreignField: "_id": The course ID in the courses collection.
    // as: "courseInfo": The joined data will be added as an array under the courseInfo field.

    // $unwind Stage: Purpose: Converts the courseInfo array into a single object.
    // After this stage, instead of an array, courseInfo is a flat object.

    // $project Stage: Selects and renames the fields for the final output.
    // _id: 0: Excludes the _id field from the output.
    // courseId: Course ID from joined data.
    // courseName: Course name from joined data.
    // studentCount: 1: Keeps the count field as is.

    // Summary of this aggregation pipeline:
    // Groups students by course.
    // Joins course details from the courses collection.
    // Flattens the course info.
    // Projects a clean output with course ID, name, and number of students.
